# Tokens

## Description

"Tokens" demonstrates how to use the NSTokenField class.  An NSTokenField is a text field containing tokens as its content. A token represents a string or other object.  A tokenâ€™s distinctive form makes it easy for users to recognize and manipulate it.  Sometimes users select the string to be tokenized from a list of possible entries presented to them, such as the list of email addresses.

The sample demonstrates the following:

Explains how to configure token fields and connect them to other objects in an application.

Displays a completion list and describes how to display a list of possible completions for the currently entered substring.

Returns represented objects and shows how to return an array of represented objects for the tokens in a token field.

Implements menus for each token, allowing the user to change the token's value.

Allows tokens to be draggable within the text field, by using NSCoder for encoding and decoding.
