# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to Twig!

A list of todo's exists in the [README.md](./README.md) and these should be focused on first before any other features are introduced. 

If you are fixing a bug or implementing a feature, feel free to open a PR.

Bug reporting is also contributing, and opening issues describing bugs helps development.
